W:Old England needs the men she breeds, There's fighting to be done.
W:Australians heard and were prepared to help her every son.
W:From out the bay they sailed away, our pride, Australia's own.
W:And so today they're far away and some in the great unknown.
W:Chorus: 
W:Boys of the Dardanelles.
W:They faced the shot and shells.
W:Down in hist'ry their fame will go
W:Our children's children their daring deeds will know.
W:Australian lads in kharki and blue 
W:Have shown the world what they can do.
W:How they fought and fell, the cables daily tell.
W:Boys of the Dardanelles.
